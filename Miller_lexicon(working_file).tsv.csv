So although excision itself may be a Cushitic influence, it may play a part in a far older ritual (Power p.c.).

This is part of female bonding, in no way enforced by the men, who see it as women’s business. After the cutting (which may be done more than once; that is, a girl may undergo maitoko more than once), the maitobee (or sometimes all the women) turn tables on the men, chasing them with naritcanda, much as the Ituri Mbuti do with switches upon menstruation. So although excision itself may be a Cushitic influence, it may play a part in a far older ritual (Power p.c.).

		[k]	A sequential auxiliary; broadly similar to ya- First impression is that it tends to be a ‘different event’ indicator, but that doesn’t always explain its behavior. As a first approximation it can be translated as ‘but’ or ‘then’ (‘but then’, ‘and then’) vs ‘and’ for ya-, and the result usually makes sense. Often ka- and ya- are interchangeable with no significant change in meaning, but sometimes only one or the other is acceptable.Without a following verb ka- may introduce a quotation, again like ya-.a group, herd, flock, swarm (human, animal (incl. bugs); cannot be used for plants or inanimates) ‘and then we …’Seeka-.
